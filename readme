My implementation of a neural network from scratch, able to create a made network and add different optimizers and shit


Pls don't be a lot of calculus :(

# Ideas for first parts:
Make a representation of data that we want our network to have, like an np array
Do we just wanna use np arrays?

Let's support 2d arrays, as we can convert them in the fitting stage. We will use numpy for math stuff, pickle for loading and saving models,
we can also use matplotlib to plot shit ig?
