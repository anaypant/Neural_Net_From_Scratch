NNFS - Neural Network Framework from Scratch

The goal of this project is to make a libary that can build and train a neural network on data.
We will make our own data structures to hold this data
We will have everything built at a very high level on top of existing python stuff

Values - These will be any real numbers which we can do math on and keep info on
Lists - These can hold values and keep collections of values together, maybe will have some kind of memory
